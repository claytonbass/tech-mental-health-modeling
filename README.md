# tech-mental-health-modeling
A project that explores 2014 responses to a mental health in tech survey that gauges prevalence of mental health issues across the US, UK, and other selected countries. The goal is to not only explore underlying trends in the data but also to build models that can predict the risk of severe mental health issues based upon factors like geography, age, self-employment status, and employer size.
